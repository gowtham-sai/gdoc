Gdoc - API documentation generated from rspecs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gdoc'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gdoc

## Usage
You just need to run rspec, gem is cleaver enough to figure it out.
Requirements:
In your spec file, whenever you want to document a request, just `:api_doc => true` as shown below.
	1. You must add `api_doc => true` to spec
	2. spec must and should have request and response objects.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
